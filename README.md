# Binary_Classification_Handwritten_Printed_Images

CNN model to classify handwritten and machine text from [RVL CDIP dataset](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~aharley/rvl-cdip/). 

The dataset is a modified version of the RVL CDIP dataset and contains only two classes: handwritten and newspaper images. The dataset can be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1t2vUqL_Y79F_A5N1BaGGMg735QlDA7jG/view?usp=sharing). Unzip the model in the base directory.

The trained model can be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1R8QJ_-dlPDf3RVphBzrf0ZTXkvjJmSyU/view?usp=sharing). Create a new folder called "model" and put the model in this folder.

More information about the model and the steps taken to solve this problem are in the [DOCUMENTATION.md](https://github.com/Cliche1998/Binary_Classification_Handwritten_Printed_Images/blob/main/DOCUMENTATION.md)
